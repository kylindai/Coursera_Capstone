# Car accident severity prediction

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The World Health Organization describes the road traffic system as the most complex and the most dangerous system with which people have to deal every day. In the last few years, the number of road traffic deaths in the world climbed, reaching 1.35 million in 2016. 
More particularly in Seattle City, US, 359 people were killed in 2018, more than a thousand were seriously injured and tens of thousands have suffered small injuries. Meanwhile, Big Data Analytics has emerged in the last decade as a set of techniques allowing data scientists to extract meaningful information from large amounts of complex and heterogeneous data. In the context of accident prediction, such techniques provide insights on the conditions leading to an increased risk of road accidents, which in return, can be used to develop traffic-related policies and prevention operations.
